            <p>Hi there! You're not supposed to see this.</p>
            <p>If you are seeing this, please look away.</p>
            <p>This page is a leftover from when I was testing how to consistently have a navigation bar without copy/pasting it everywhere.</p>
            <p>I would like to make more pages, but updating them all the time is a pain. So this was a test to hopefully fix that.</p>
            <p>If you're still reading this, I'm sorry to tell you that you've wasted your time.</p>
            <p>But I guess you could tell me how you found this page.</p>
            <p>Or how your day was.</p>
            <p style='font-size: 0.01px'>Can someone ask how my day is for a change? Not just as a formality.</p>
            <p>Anyway, if you found your way here, I'm sure you can find your way out.</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by. See ya.</p>
