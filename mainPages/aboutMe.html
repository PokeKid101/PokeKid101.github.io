                <p>This website was originally created to be used as a final project for a class.
                   However, I decided to then use it to host both various tools/resources for my personal use along with being a somewhat strange way to organize my ideas.
                   Being hosted on Github, as it really is the only free resource that I could use (also means I'm kinda limited to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. no fancy web server for me).
                   If you find anything on this website useful or interesting feel free to stick around.
                   If your an employer... Hopefully this is impressing you.

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Currently enrolled as a student at Florida Tech (GO PANTHERS!!!), studying both Electrical and Computer Engineering (double majoring, yipee).
                   I enjoy programming, electronics, and games.
                   Beyond that.... umm.....
                   
                    
                </p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>Guess there isn't much beyond that. Sorry.
                   I'm really not the most interesting of people to be honest.
                   Well... thanks for visiting my website.
                </p>
