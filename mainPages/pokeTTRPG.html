                <h1>Landon's Pokemon TTRPG</h1>
                <p>Currently developing my own Pokemon TTRPG system.
                   Played a couple Pokemon TTRPG systems and seem more, but didn't really like any of them.
                   So I am making my own system which is mainly based on DnD and PTU.
                   Still a work in progress, but enough progress has been made to justify putting it on the website.
                   Most of the work is currently in a long Google Doc, but putting more finalized ideas here (and to better organize them).
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   At some point the name will change, "Landon's Pokemon TTRPG" is the temparary name.
                </p>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Make a TTRPG for Pokemon. 
                       Many have tried and although they haven’t failed, I (Landon) dislike their systems. 
                       Many feel clucky to use and others have a lot of paperwork and number crunching. 
                       I want to make a Pokemon TTRPG that is simple, straightforward, and fun. 
                       The system will be a Mystery Dungeon system, where players are the Pokemon.

                    <h2>System Basics</h2>
                    <p>Players have stats similar to base Pokemon (HP, Atk, Def, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed) to not be overwhelming to new players and to be familiar with players already associated with Pokemon to understand the system more easily.
                       Players have skills that are improved separately (similarly to PTU) with a d6 system.
                       Players can also choose classes that give them more features to use during gameplay.
