                   These pages are dedicated to the many ideas I have for games I would like to develop.
                   All these games are located in the same universe, and I refer to them all as the Terita Project.
                   For now I'll be filling these pages with random ideas and thoughts that I have for these games, and using this site as a base to develop the world of Terita.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority of my ideas are stuck in my head, but I'll be trying my best to update this site both as a way to generate interest and to have organization for myself.
                    There is a list of games and a brief description of what they are, but they are projects that I intend to come back to.
                    If I do end up working on one of these projects, it will be both small scale and might not have much emphasis on the lore.

                <p>This is where I would put some of my recent ideas.
                   Not sure though, they are still half-baked.
                   However to be fair, I'm not the best baker.
