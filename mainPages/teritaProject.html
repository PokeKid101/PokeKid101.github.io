                <p>These pages are dedicated to the many ideas I have for games I would like to develop.
                   All these games are located in the same universe, and I refer to them all as the Terita Project.
                   For now I'll be filling these pages with random ideas and thoughts that I have for these games, and using this site as a base to develop the world of Terita.

                </p>
                <p>The majority of my ideas are stuck in my head, but I'll be trying my best to update this site both as a way to generate interest and to have organization for myself.
                   There is a list of games and a brief description of what they are, but they are projects that I intend to come back to.
                   If I do end up working on one of these projects, it will be both small scale and might not have much emphasis on the lore.

                <p>This is where I would put some of my recent ideas.
                   Not sure though, they are still half-baked.
                   However to be fair, I'm not the best baker.

                <h3>Terita</h3>
                <p><i>The</i> game I want to make, the ultimate goal, my dream game.
                   The beginnings of an expansive universe and the start to this project.
                   This entire project started from the early ideas of this game, thus why this project is named after it.
                   I think it would very poetic to make this last, but really I just want to make it when I've developed better (or any) game development skills.
                </p>
                <p>The game idea itself has gone through a lot since it's initial idea back when I first thought of it in high school.
                   Although the original vision for the project has passed, what it is at its core is the same.
                   A mix of monster catcher/collector, town building, and slight farming. 
                   A lot true, but it works great in my head (and hopefully later I'll realize how large of an idea it really is).
                   I've thought about this game a lot, to the point that I started making an entire universe.
                   With this game as just a part of that universe, kinda tucked into the corner unphased by the other aspects.
                                      
                </p>
                
                
                <h3>"Warped Reality"</h3>
                <p>The title is still a work in progress (as with all my projects), but it represents how I originally saw this game going.
                   Thinking of making this the first game I publish, as it would work well as a short game (both scope and length) with a reason to replay it at least once.
                   The idea is to make it a small RPG, with a handful of characters you can choose to play as.
                   I think a larger emphasis will be introducing the world of Terita (the universe, not the game) and establishing some basic game development skills.
                                       
                </p>
                
                
                <h3>Tavern Builder/Card Game</h3>
                <p>Stranger concept I've perceived, but I would still work and feel well in the Terita universe.
                   Essentially, you are a tavern owner and must maintain a healthy and thriving tavern.
                   The main attraction of your tavern is a card game native to the universe of Terita.
                   I have no current idea when or if I'll make this game, but it is a fun idea.
