                Hextraction is a 3D printed game which can be found <a href="https://www.playhextraction.com/" class="inTextLink">here</a>.
                In essence, Hextraction has players use a variety of 3D printed tiles with the goal of getting a marble to the bottom of the track.
                Players must strategically place their tiles on the board such that they will be the first to successfully get the marble to the end of the track.
                Although there are a variety of tiles for players to use, the best part of Hextraction is that players have the ability to create their own tiles that have unique effects.
                A tile can be a simple track, a mechanical device, or have a special effect. So long as it can fit in a hexagon, it's fair game.

                This page is dedicated to special tiles that I either have created or have ideas for.
                Links to download tiles once fully developed will be provided.
