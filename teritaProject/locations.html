                <h3>Void Lake</h3>
                <p>Within the deepest parts of the Teritan Islands, the last collections of Void sits and waits.
                   A large lake filled with a dark liquid that resembles more of a bottomless pit rather than a lake.
                   A small dock is at the edge of the lake, that points directly to the center of the lake and the pyramidal intrusion that sticks out.

                <h3>Center Town</h3>
                <p>Located in the exact center of the Cornucopia, Center Town is one of the larger settlements within the Cornucopia.
                   Built around the Center Inn, Center Town has become a staple for passing travelers and is one of the main hubs for trading.
                   Although it doesn't have any officially developed form of government or law the people of Center Town have extended the rules established in the Center Inn to the rest of the town.
                   The Owner of the Center Inn had and has no intentions of running/maintaining the town, but is humbled that he has set such a good example.

                <h3>The Wastes</h3>
                <p>The area surrounding the Cornucopia, and presumably the remaining parts of the world.
                   These areas incorporates a mixture of radioactive areas along with ruined parts of the world.
                   Similar to Fallout wastes, but less radioactive and filled with less (if any) life.

                </p>
                
                <h3>ImagiCorp Labs</h3>
                <p>On the outer edges of the Cornucopia lies some of the more intact ruins of the world before.
                   One of these ruins is the remains of the main ImagiCorp Labs, which used to be a large global research organization.
                   A lot of their remaining research and technology has spawned the creation of both higher tech civilizations and the "magical" arts.
                   There is some evidence that ImagiCorp is responsible for the transformation of the world into what it is, along with some of the darker aspects of the world.
