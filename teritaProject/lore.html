            <p>This page is dedicated to the various aspects of the world of Terita that either pertain to the lore or do not fit anywhere else.

            <div id="void">
                <h2>Void</h2>
                <p>Void is a black semi-liquid substance that has a consistent presence throughout the universe, multiverse, and various other dimensions.
                   After the Council creates a new plane of existence, void will then appear in that plane. 
                   This is done outside the Council's knowledge, and is one of the reasons why the Council oversees and maintains universes.
                   
                </p>
                <p>Void is both a physical and metaphorical representation of change and acts as a catalyst for said change to happen.
                   It is one of the main reasons why the Council is necessary, to maintain planes of existence (the multiverses) from the effects of void.
                   Because void is a catalyst for change, the effects of void are both unpredictable and immeasurable. 
                   Unfortunately, the Council is unable to control void or its effects, so the best they can do is deal with the aftermath of void's effects.
                   
                </p>
                <p>From a story telling perspective, void is just a tool to enact some sort of rapid or onset change both with its direct and indirect effects.
                   Void will be used differently in different scenarios, and this is intentional.
                   Partly because it is easier to mold a story using the same "magic goo" to create the change for the story to happen.
                   However, I mostly find a substance that is itself a catalyst and core to how the existence evolves (either with or against void) very interesting.
                   Imaging a universe or multiverse as some sort of ecosystem, void would be the equivalent to some external factor creating rapid change to said ecosystem.
                   These external factors could be natural disasters, invasive species, human involvement, extinction level events, and more which will have significant changes to the ecosystem.
                   However, the change void brings isn't inherently negative, it can create very positive effects as well.
                   It ultimately comes down to how change is both seen and used, which I think can make for some really cool stories.
                   
                </p>
                
                <h2>Purpose of The Council</h2>
                <p>The Council are a group of entities that oversee the multiverse of multiverses, which they refer to as The Collection.
                   Their sole purpose is to create, oversee, and maintain The Collection, as to ensure each universe can run self sufficiently.  
                   They obstain from directly interacting with the contents of The Collection, both to ensure their identies remain hidden and to reframe any particular universe from becoming too reliant on The Coucil's support.
                   However, they do have many ways to indirectly influence The Collection, such as influencing times of peace or destruction and appointing god-like beings to embody various aspects.
                   The Council commonly will compare The Collection to an ecosystem, a complex and immersive system that can maintain itself yet always in danger of outside factors that can leave a significant scar, or worse irreversable change.
                </p>
                <p>On very rare occations, The Council will sample individuals residing within The Collection.
                   These individuals range from both good hearted and the most vile of people, but are all treated with the same respect.
                   These individuals are then intervied by The Council, usually by just a member or two that would be best suited for the individual.
                   The purpose of these interviews is to gain a better perspective if the methods to maintain The Collection are effective.
                   Typically, these interviews are held when a universe appears to be dying and these interviews assist in rejuvenating the dying universe.
                </p>
                <p>Currently, The Council has a very adept knowledge on how to best structure dimensions, universes, and multiverses to ensure self sufficiently.
                   However, this implies that The Council has had to learn how to create and maintain these universes on their own, which is true.
                   There is a very special room within The Council dedicated to remembering all the lost and died worlds within The Collection, called The Lost Halls.
                   The first entries to The Lost Halls died as a result of The Council's lack of understanding on how to do their job.
                   After The Council became adept at creating and maintaining universes, The Lost Halls did not see new entries for a long time.
                   Recently, The Council's greatest and only foe, Void, has become more and more of a problem, resulting in new entries to The Lost Halls.
