            <h1>Terita | Lore</h1>
            <p>This page is dedicated to the various aspects of the world of Terita that either pertain to the lore or do not fit anywhere else.
                              
            </p>
            
            <div id="void">
                <h2>Void</h2>
                <p>Void is a black semi-liquid substance that has a consistent presence throughout the universe, multiverse, and various other dimensions.
                   After the Council creates a new plane of existence, void will then appear in that plane. 
                   This is done outside the Council's knowledge, and is one of the reasons why the Council oversees and maintains multiverses.
                   
                </p>
                <p>Void is both a physical and metaphorical representation of change and acts as a catalyst for said change to happen.
                   It is one of the main reasons why the Council is necessary, to maintain planes of existence (the multiverses) from the effects of void.
                   Because void is a catalyst for change, the effects of void are both unpredictable and immeasurable. 
                   Unfortunately, the Council is unable to control void or its effects, so the best they can do is deal with the aftermath of void's effects.
                   
                </p>
                <p>From a story telling perspective, void is just a tool to enact some sort of rapid or onset change both with its direct and indirect effects.
                   Void will be used differently in different scenarios, and this is intentional.
                   Partly because it is easier to mold a story using the same "magic goo" to create the change for the story to happen.
                   However, I mostly find a substance that is itself a catalyst and core to how the existence evolves (either with or against void) very interesting.
                   Imaging a universe or multiverse as some sort of ecosystem, void would be the equivalent to some external factor creating rapid change to said ecosystem.
                   These external factors could be natural disasters, invasive species, human involvement, extinction level events, and more which will have significant changes to the ecosystem.
                   However, the change void brings is inherently negative, it can create very positive effects as well.
                   It ultimately comes down to how change is both seen and used, which I think can make for some really cool stories.
