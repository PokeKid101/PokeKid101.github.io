            <p>This page is dedicated to the various peoples that can be found around the universe of Terita.
               This includes communities, races, and other groups of people.

                <h2>Teritan Tribes</h2>
                <p>There are four tribes that live on the Teritan Islands: Green, Red, Blue, and Black. The original people came over when the Human race was young, then began living peacefully among the Terita. However, when Zack and Steve arrived, they discovered some of the void on the island. After they left, the original islands split into the four current tribes. The Green tribe focuses on learning and living with the Terita on the island. The Blue tribe focuses on learning about the environments on the Islands and discovering the lore of the Teritans. The Red tribe knows about the lore relating to void and the Teritans, they primarily defend the Island from outsiders who would seek to use the powers of void.

                <h2>The Council</h2>
                <p>The Council are the highest level of entities in the universe, both this universe and others. They are a group of individuals that represent both physical and metaphorical concepts. Their job is to both create and maintain the collection of multiverses, universes, dimensions, and other planes of existence. Each one wants to see the universes they create survive and thrive, and thus use the elements they represent. Their goal is to see that universes become self-sufficient like how an ecosystem functions, even with the hard ship. However, there is one large problem the Council face and that is void. No matter what they try to do, void appears in each universe. Additionally, the only member of the Council that is absent and has never been seen, is Void.

They occasionally do interviews with entities within universes to understand how the universe is doing, and how they can do their jobs better.
They create, appoint, or find beings within multiverses to be their avatars, and to better manage the multiverse in which they reside. These beings then have the free will to either become gods or reside themselves, whatever they see fit to better accomplish their task.
